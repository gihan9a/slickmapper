=== Description ===
SlickMapper is inspired by and based off of SlickMap CSS created by Matt Everson of Astuteo, LLC (http://astuteo.com/slickmap). This theme simply integrates SlickMap CSS into WordPress.

For the sake of optimal performance, SlickMap CSS relies heavily on CSS pseudo
classes and elements. The default styles also include a few CSS3 specific
elements (rounded corners, RGBA colors) which you are free to modify, expand
upon, or eliminate at will. 

SlickMap CSS was created for web designers, and such was tested and developed
for use with Safari, Firefox, Opera, and other standards-compliant browsers. 
Because of that, current versions of Internet Explorer (and probably IE 
versions long into the future) might look like sh*t. And I don't really careâ 
though you're welcome to suggest improvements in that arena. 

SlickMap CSS is free of charge, free to share, and free to modify. It
includes a snippet of Eric Meyer's browser reset stylesheet:
